The R code shared here was used for the analysis of JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) transcriptome data. This repository also contains a portion of the data analyzed in the paper.

# Code
1. Fig3_JCPyV_transcripts.r<br>
   For visualization of JCPyV transcripts identified in the study.<br>
2. Fig4_Fig5_bubble_chart.r<br>
   For visualization of read counts obtained in JCPyV wraparound amplicon sequencing using a bubble chart.<br>
3. Fig6_JCPyV_NCCR.r<br>
   For visualization of the noncoding control region (NCCR) of the JCPyV genome from the brain tissues of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) patients.<br>
